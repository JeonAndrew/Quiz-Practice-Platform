The Quiz Practice Platform is a web application that students can use to study and practice for exams of numerous courses. Tailors its quizzes to the needs of the student. It allows students to choose what course they would like to practice for, and students may select topics within each course they would like to focus on. Quizzes will give students a multiple choice question that they can answer or choose to skip; the correct answer will be revealed after each problem regardless of their choice.

Clone the Quiz Practice Platform from the main branch into your code editor (i.e. Visual Studio Code). From here, the folder should have a dockerfile, so open the folder in a docker container, which should have all of the python dependencies to start running the code. If they are not all present, just use pip install to install the remaining dependencies. From here, download the secret key file used to access the firebase backend / database. Place that file in quiz-backend/src, and change the file path in app.py in the same folder to reflect the path of this file with the secret key. After doing so, running python app.py in this directory should start up the flask server and accessing the localhost / ip should provide access to the website. 

Note: The secret key is vital to running the website since the app.py which the app runs on requires it to have access to the database. This cannot be committed since it throws flags / errors and is disabled by Google which will prompt the need for a new secret key.
